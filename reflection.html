				This has been fun project to work on throughout this semesester. The
				most difficult thing for me to grasp is php. I feel like I have a pretty
				solid understanding of web development, so the web design portion has
				been pretty striaght forward for me. Now that we are approaching the
				end, I feel like I now also have a pretty good understanding of
				server-side programming. At least a better understanding of php. Going
				in to this semesester I have had some previous experience with Nodejs
				backend coding. But in order to be successful in this course I needed to
				use php. The biggest challenge I had with this project was,
				understanding how to get the data from submitting a form. I had to look
				through all of the previous projects to see what had been done. After
				finally understanding how this was done, I modified it in a way that I
				would better understand that still gave me the result I needed. My
				personal take aways from this project are to prove to myself that I can
				create a cool user interface with the skills I already have web design.
				Also to take the things I have learned in this class and put them to the
				test. Another take away I am hoping for is a good grade. I have had a
				pretty rough college experience and my GPA is not the greatest, but if I
				am able to get all A's this semester I can gradute with a 3.0. So
				hopefully my final product is worthy of a great grade.
