			<p>
				My application is going to be similar to a job search tool. It is going
				to allow a business to have a list of jobs available and allow
				candidates to sign in and apply for those positions. To do this I am
				going to create a users database which will keep track of user
				information that is accessible to the employer. There will also be a
				database of applications, that will hold all of the information gathered
				from the user database for the application for the job. I have chosen to
				create this application, because I think it is very important for
				companies to have a tool to allow people to apply. I think it is also
				important for that tool to be very powerful and simplistic.
